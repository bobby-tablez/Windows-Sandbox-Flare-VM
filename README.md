# Windows Sandbox - Flare VM
This config file will automatically convert a temporary Windows Sandbox environment into a Flare VM for malware analysis.

## Instructions
Install WSB (Windows Sandbox) and ensure all prerequisites are met:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview

Simply save this config (modify as neccissary) and be sure to preserve the ".wsb" extension. 

Execute the .wsb file and a new sandbox VM will spawn and the script to install FlareVM will auto-execute. This can take some time so grab a coffee!
